### :a: About
  
Deal or No Deal was a gameshow broadcast on Channel 4 from 2005 to 2009 hosted by Noel Edmunds. 

Deal or No Deal starts with 22 numbered boxes each with an unknown value of between 1p and Â£250,000 contained in them, these are then randomly chosen by the 22 contestants. A contestant is then chosen to play Deal or No Deal and sit in the hot seat for that game with their chosen box. They then play a series of 'rounds' where they chose to eliminate the remaining boxes one by one - hopefully avoiding the boxes containing the big money.

The twist to Deal or No Deal comes in at the end of each round when the 'Banker' - a mysterious off-screen person offers the contestant a sum of money to 'buy' the box that the contestant has in front off of them and end the game. This sum of money is based on the amount of cash left in the remaining boxes.
